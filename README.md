# Shortcut how to use this code
1. Maybe this program need react-script and other component in below
2. npm run server || npm start (Use split terminal to run both of command)

# React component
React : npx create-react-app nameOfNewFolder\
Animasi :  npm i react-reveal --legacy-peer-deps\
Modal : npm install react-modal

# Server component
nodemon globally :  npm install nodemon || Package Json script || Add server.js\
other pacakages : npm install express body-parser mongoose shortid\
this step : we need mongodb + postman + npm run server

View (React component)\
Action (Dispatch action type to store)\
Store (State hub)\
Reducers (Update and Modify State or CRUD) (Receive request and Send response)\
Store (State hub for receive response) (View renders when state changes)\
View (show views changes)

# Add redux
